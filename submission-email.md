Dear Sam,

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to Ascend Nonprofit Solutions' RFP for the Organizational Transformation and Optimization Project. We are pleased to submit our comprehensive proposal, "**Ascend Higher: Cross-Functional Transformation for 25% Growth**."

Our collaborative team—Meet the Moment and Rebecca Coker—brings a unique combination of deep nonprofit shared services expertise specifically tailored to your needs:

• 70+ years combined experience in nonprofit shared services  
• Direct MSP operational experience scaling from 50 to 200+ clients  
• Charlotte-based presence through Rebecca Coker  
• Proven track record achieving 20-40% efficiency gains  
• Expertise across your entire technology stack (Microsoft 365, Blackbaud FE NXT, Paycom, SuperOps)

Our proposal directly addresses your priority of transforming cross-functional workflows across Finance, HR, and IT. We've structured our approach to deliver immediate value through Phase 0 Quick Wins while building toward your goal of serving 25% more agencies without increasing expenses.

## Key highlights of our proposal:

• **Phase 0 Quick Wins** approach delivering value in weeks 1-4  
• **Total investment of $235,000** (within your budget parameters)  
• **~20 scalable onsite days** with Rebecca based locally in Charlotte  
• **Proven Switch Framework** for change management with experienced teams  
• **Implementation-focused approach**—not just recommendations

We understand the critical nature of this transformation as you prepare for Southeast expansion while managing the Paycom migration and current budget constraints. Our team has successfully navigated similar challenges, including our own transformation of RoundTable Technology from $350K to $8M in revenue.

Please find attached our detailed proposal PDF. We've also created an interactive website for easy review and sharing with your board: https://joshuamtm.github.io/ascend-proposal-site/

## We are prepared to:

• Execute the mutual NDA immediately upon selection  
• Begin Phase 0 Quick Wins in September 2025  
• Participate in any Q&A sessions you schedule

Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to partnering with Ascend to achieve your transformation goals and enable your expanded mission throughout the Southeast.
